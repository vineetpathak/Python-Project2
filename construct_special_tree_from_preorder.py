# Program to construct a special tree from preorder traversal

# Given an array ‘pre[]’ that represents Preorder traversal of a spacial binary tree where every node has either 0 or 2 children. One more array ‘preLN[]’ is given which has only two possible values ‘L’ and ‘N’. The value ‘L’ in ‘preLN[]’ indicates that the corresponding node in Binary Tree is a leaf node and value ‘N’ indicates that the corresponding node is non-leaf node.
