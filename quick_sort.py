	Quick sort

	Quick sort is based on the divide-and-conquer approach based on the idea of choosing one element as a pivot element 
	and partitioning the array around it such that: Left side of pivot contains all the elements that are less than the pivot
	element Right side contains all elements greater than the pivot.
