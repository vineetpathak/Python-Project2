'''
	Write a function to detect if two trees are isomorphic. Two trees are called isomorphic if one of them can be
	obtained from other by a series of flips, i.e. by swapping left and right children of a number of nodes. Any
	number of nodes at any level can have their children swapped. Two empty trees are isomorphic.
